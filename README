ZENBURN

Zenburn is a low-contrast color scheme for Vim. It’s easy for your eyes and
designed to keep you in the zone for long programming sessions.

Zenburn has been ported to many different editors and environments. For more

No:
  - dayglo vomit
  - black, red, blue and green on screaming white background

INSTALLATION

To use Zenburn in GVim, simply copy the file to colors/ subdirectory under your
Vim configuration folder (e.g. ~/.vim/colors or C:\vim\colors).

To use Zenburn in Vim, you must enable the 256-color mode for Vim. This can be
done with e.g. export TERM=xterm-256color. You might also need to add set
t_Co=256 into your .vimrc file, before loading the colorscheme. Note, that due
to limitations of the 256-color mode the color scheme is not exactly like it
appears in GVim, but very close nevertheless.

To load Zenburn in Vim/GVim:

  :colors zenburn

To automatically load the colors upon startup of Vim, add this to .vimrc:

  colors zenburn

DEVELOPERS

Captain Obvious says: make a symlink from ~/.vim/colors/zenburn.vim which
points to the real zenburn.vim. This way you don't need to copy files around
and making the Vimball is easy!

MAKING A VIMBALL

To make a Vimball, open zb-vimball.txt and then :MkVimball zenburn.vba
